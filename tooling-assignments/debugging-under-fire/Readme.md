# Debugging Under Fire

This GOTO 2017 talk analyzes debugging complex, distributed systems under extreme pressure. Bryan Cantrill uses real-world examples, including a critical Joyent outage, to illustrate the challenges. The presentation explores how semi-automated systems introduce unique debugging problems.
