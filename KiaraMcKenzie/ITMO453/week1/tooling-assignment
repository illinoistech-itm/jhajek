# ITMO 453 Tooling Assignments

In this exercise we will install tools needed to be able to accomplish our jobs during the semester.  The first thing we need to do is install a package manager for MacOS and or Windows 10. Then we will install modern opensource shell software and then the Git-SCM version control tool we will need for the semester to submit our work.  

**Deliverable:** Complete the necessary install steps for either MacOS or Windows10 and supply the requested screenshots below each header.  To submit this Readme.md file, in your private repo provided to you, under the itmo-453 folder, create a folder named: **week-01**, then a folder under that named: **tooling-assignment**.  Push your Readme.md (this file) to that location.

## Package Managers for Windows

There are two package managers for Windows 10. [Chocolatey.org](https://chocolatey.org/ "Chocolatey.org download page") is the Windows 3rd party package manager.  [Winget](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-package-manager-1-0/ "Winget Instal URL") is the Microsoft first party package manager. Place a screenshot of the version command output for wither: `winget -v` or `choco -v`

## Installation of PowerShell Core for Windows

Using Chocolatey (choco) or Winget install [PowerShell Core 7.1.x](https://chocolatey.org/packages/powershell-core "PowerShell Core 7 Download from choco").  Place a screenshot of the initial PowerShell 7 screen.  Add screenshot of the output of: ```ssh -V```.  

## Installation of a Terminal for Windows

A Terminal is a way to run multiple shell and cmd line windows in a single managed window.  On Windows install Microsoft Terminal from either place:

* [Windows Terminal Microsoft Store Install](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab "Install Windows Terminal from Microsoft Store")

* `winget install terminal`

## Install Git for Windows

Using the package manager of your choice, install the Git Client if you do not already have it installed.  **Note**, this is different from the GitHub Desktop tool, which we will not be using this semester (which is a fine piece of software).

Place a screenshot of the output of the command: ```git --version```

You will need to configure Git if you already haven't done so.  From a shell run these two commands:

```bash

git config --global user.name "<Your Name>"
git config --global user.email "<youremail@example.com>"
```

## Install IDE editor

After installing an IDE editor of your choice, pick one of the listed or you can use another one, but it needs to have native Git support built into the editor.  Take a screenshot of output of the help > about button in the application.  You can install all or any of these via the package managers Chocolatey or Winget.

  * Cross platform and has direct shell integration
* [atom.io](https://atom.io/ "Atom.io install")
