## Course Catalog Description

This course covers both concepts and practical applications of distributed data paradigms. This provides a comparison between SQL, MapReduce, and Spark Frameworks. The course focuses on how to treat and prepare unstructured data to be used in the MapReduce framework for parallel processing. Students will be tasked with learning and demonstrating the MapReduce framework through implementing the Hadoop framework and associated Java technology. [ITMD 521 Bulletin Description](http://bulletin.iit.edu/courses/itmd/ "ITMD 521 Bulletin Description")

## Updated Course Description

This course covers both concepts and practical applications of distributed data paradigms. We will explore cloud native tooling used for Big Data. We will focus on the concepts of Data Engineering and explore the Data Life Cyle. We will apply these concepts using opensource Big Data platforms and by writing code to explore the concepts of Data Engineering. You will have an experience how to treat and prepare structured and unstructured Big Data. Students will be tasked with learning and demonstrating these concepts via a hands on final project.

You will be able to install, implement, and demonstrate the software that allows you to use these paradigms. You will be able to explain the concept of Data Engineering and the Data Life Cycle.

## Course Objectives

Students completing this course will be able to:
  
* Describe the task of a Data Engineer
* Describe the life cycle and accumulation of data
* Deploy a remote Spark Application to a Spark cluster
* Demonstrate loading data from disparate data sources and discuss advantages

### Readings

Readings for the class will be assigned from the textbooks; there will be additional reading assigned in the form of online reading. All readings should be done before coming to class on the assigned date, and are mandatory and expected.  Generally if you do the readings you will excel in the course, as the lectures serve as a clarification and explanation of material you should already be familiar with.

### Course Notes

It is recommended to take notes from the discussion portion of the class.

### Attendance

Attendance is expected and will be counted as part of your grade -- if you are not able to attend please email me

### Course Web Site

[http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL")

The course will make use of Blackboard [http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL") for communications, assignment submissions, group project coordination, providing online resources and administering examinations. All remote students will view the course lectures online via Blackboard, and online readings and other course material will be found on Blackboard.

### Assignments

Lab Assignment: There will be 10 lab assignments
Final Project: The will be a final project detailed and presented during the final exam period

### Grading

Grading criteria for (undergrad course number) students will be as follows:

Letter | Description | Percentage
-------|-------------|------------
A | Outstanding work reflecting substantial effort | 90-100%
B | Excellent work reflecting good effort | 80-89.99%
C | Satisfactory work meeting minimum expectations | 70-79.99%
E | Unsatisfactory work |0-69.99%

The final grade for the class will be calculated as follows:

Name | Grade | Total Points
------------------|----------|-----------
Lab Assignments | 30% | 100 (10pts each x10)
Midterm Exam | 30% | 100 points
Final Project | 30% | 100 points
Attendance | 10% | 30 points

### Late Submission

By default no late work will be accepted – barring situations beyond our control.

### Academic Honesty

All work you submit in this course must be your own. That includes code and code samples taken from the internet.

### Plagiarism

You must fully attribute all material directly quoted in papers and you must document all sources used in the preparation of the paper using complete, APA-style bibliographic entries. Including directly quoted material in an assignment without attribution or a bibliography entry for the source of the material is always plagiarism and will always be treated as such by me. No more than thirty-three percent of material included in any paper may be direct quotes. Students have submitted plagiarized material in seven of the last eight times I have taught this course and I will not tolerate it. If you submit plagiarized material you WILL receive a grade of ZERO for the assignment or exam question, an Academic Honesty Violation Report will be filed, and it may result in your expulsion from the course with a failing grade as per the IIT and ITM academic honesty policies. There is no excuse for not understanding this policy and if you do not understand it please let me know and I will be happy to discuss it with you until you do

Dealing with code -- you need to respect opensource licenses and in the absence of a clear license be careful cutting and pasting code without attributing source. A good metric would be to add a comment in your code with a link to the original source to protect yourself.

### Collaboration

We will use Discord for all class questions and disucssion

### Our Contract

This syllabus is my contract with you as to what I will deliver and what I expect from you. If I change the syllabus, I will issue a revised version of the syllabus; the latest version will always be available on Blackboard. Revisions to readings and assignments will be communicated via Blackboard and via version control in GitHub

### Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities.  In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible.  My office hours are listed on the first page of the syllabus. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3424 S. State St., room 1C3-2 (on the first floor), telephone 312 567.5744 or disabilities@iit.edu

### ARC Tutoring Center

The university provides a free tutoring and study center called the [ARC](https://www.iit.edu/arc "IIT Resource Center URL").  This is located newly in the basement of the Galvin Library and is open to all for walk in appointments as well as scheduled tutoring.

### Illinois Tech Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information

Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process. You can report sexual harassment electronically at [iit.edu/incidentreport](iit.edu/incidentreport "IIT Incident Report URL"), which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Esther Espeland at eespeland@iit.edu.

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@iit.edu or (312)567-7550

For a comprehensive list of resources regarding counseling services, medical assistance, legal assistance and visa and immigration services, you can visit the Office of Title IX Compliance website at [https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources](https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources "IIT Title IX resources").
