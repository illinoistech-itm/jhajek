## Objectives

* Video record your learnings from the lab
* Answer the questions to explain your work briefly

## Outcomes

* At the completion of this video recording part of Lab 01, you will have compiled a significant Spark application with an explanation of how the code works. 

## Pre-reqs

For this portion of the assignment you will need to have software installed on your computer to be able to screen record, record audio, and record your web cam to produce and explanation video for your homework submission.
