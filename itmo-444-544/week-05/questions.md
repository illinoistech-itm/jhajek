# Chapter 01 - Designing for a Distributed World

1. What is distributed computing?

2. Describe the three major composition patterns in distributed computing.

3. What are the three patterns discussed for storing state?

4. Sometimes a master server does not reply with an answer but instead replies with where the answer can be found. What are the benefits of this method?

5. Section 1.4 describes a distributed file system, including an example of how reading terabytes of data would work. How would writing terabytes of data work?

6. Explain each component of the CAP Principle. (If you think the CAP Principle is awesome, read “The Part-Time Parliament” (Lamport & Marzullo 1998) and “Paxos Made Simple” (Lamport 2001).)

7. What does it mean when a system is loosely coupled? What is the advantage of these systems?

8. How do we estimate how fast a system will be able to process a request such as retrieving an email message?

9. In Section 1.7 three design ideas are presented for how to process email deletion requests. Estimate how long the request will take for deleting an email message for each of the three?  Use the updated numbers from the book located at: [Numbers Every Developer Needs to know](https://colin-scott.github.io/personal_website/research/interactive_latency.html "Link to numbers every developer needs to know") - update of Figure 1.10 in the book. SHOW WORK!
