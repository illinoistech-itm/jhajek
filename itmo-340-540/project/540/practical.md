# Final Practical Exam

Using the diagram in the question section, you are to describe the process, "A day in the life of a packet." You will describe each step computer A in the Computer Science Network will take to get an IP address and successfully send a packet to netflix.com (in our network). Essentially you will be explaining a "WireShark" trace packet level of everything that must happen to make our example work.

## Assumptions

* Assume that Computer A is powered off when starting the exercise
* Assume that there are no entries in the ARP table
* Assume that 192.168.1.10 was the previous IP Address assigned to Computer A
* You can use any detail you want from the questions.md and or readme.md

## Questions

Though not limited to only these questions, here are some items to consider:

* Which protocol helps you learn about other computers on your Local Area Network
* What are the steps to get an IP address?
* How is a packet routed?
* How is a webpage (netflix.com) requested?
* What is the sequence used to make an http request?

## Deliverable

You will take a screen recording of you explaining the process outline above, you can use the diagram and or a pointer to help, as long as your voice and face are shown.

This portion is worth 30 points.

* 5 Points for formatting, sharing link, and having the correct sharing permissions
* 5 Points for introducing yourself in the video and having the camera on
* 20 Points for correct sequencing information

You can make use of any screen capture technology you would like and render the capture as a MP4 or OGG/Vorbis equivalent. Upload it to your IIT Google Drive, give permissions to share the video via link, and submit that shared link to Blackboard as the deliverable. Please test this.

### Screen Capture Tool Suggestion

If you haven't used any screen capture tools - I would recommend the [OBS Project](https://obsproject.com/ "webpage for OBS Project"). The Open Broadcaster Software project is cross-platform and is a suite of tools used for screen capture and podcasting. I like it because there is a pretty straight forward record button and the recording is dumped instantly into an MP4.
