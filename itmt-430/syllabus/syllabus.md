## Course Catalog Description

In this capstone course, students will identify, gather, analyze, and write requirements based on user needs and will then design, construct, integrate, and implement an information system as a solution to a business problem.  Students will document integration architecture, methodologies, and technologies using industry best practices.  User needs and user centered design will be applied in the selection, creation, evaluation, and administration of the resulting system.  The system design process will take into account professional, ethical, legal, security, and social issues and responsibilities and stress the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society.  Discussion will also cover the need to engage in continuing professional development. [ITMT 430 Bulletin Description](http://bulletin.iit.edu/courses/itmt/ "ITMT 430 Bulletin Description")

### Late Submission

By default no late work will be accepted – barring situations beyond our control.

### Academic Honesty

All work you submit in this course must be your own.

### Plagiarism

Dealing with code -- you need to respect opensource licenses and in the absence of a clear license be careful cutting and pasting code without attributing source. A good metric would be to add a comment in your code with a link to the original source to protect yourself.

This class won't be dealing with formal written papers.

### Illinois Tech Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information

Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process. You can report sexual harassment electronically at [iit.edu/incidentreport](iit.edu/incidentreport "IIT Incident Report URL"), which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Esther Espeland at eespeland@iit.edu.

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@iit.edu or (312)567-7550
